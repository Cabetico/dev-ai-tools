* `create snake game using react`

* `how do I run it locally` min 10:36

```bash npm create vite@latest snake-chatgpt --template react
cd snake-game
npm install
``` 

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

In this case the `npx tailwindcss init -p` will fail that's because the LLM basically looks everything they can access on the internet, then. They process all this information (I think Alexey meant the time of training). So this was some time back when 
tailwind was initialized with that command but now is different.

Solution: Tell chatgpt to use search to find the most up to date instructions for tailwindcss
Answer: `npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss`
